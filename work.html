                                With a partner, I designed a video game called Tidy For Turtles where the player must save the turtles from

                                     trash on the beach. Together, my partner and I created a
                                     project plan to divide tasks and keep track of our work. In our collaboration, I was mainly the web 
                                     developer. I developed the promotional website for the game and made the artwork for the turtles and 
                                     backgrounds in the game itself.

                            <section>
                                As part of a CVS Data Analytics Mentorship I created a machine learning model with a team to
                                <span class="ellipse">...</span>
                                <div class="hide">
                                    predict hospital patients' length of stay based on a data set. The model was programmed in python in a Jupyter Notebook environment using the
                                     pandas, seaborn, numpy, and matplot libraries. To create the model my team first performed a round of exploratory data analysis where we determined 
                                     what data we did and didn't need for our model, whether or not there were null values any where, and if there were any noticable trends or
                                      irregular data in the file. From there we cleaned the data set by dropping rows with null catgegorical values and replacing null numercia 
                                      values with the avergage for that specific column. We also one hot encoded certain categorical data columns so that they could be used in 
                                      the model. From there we split the data into testing and training data and created the model our linear regression using scikit and mat plot. 
                                      The model above is a the linear regression model of the predictions.

                                Using Blender I created a 3D Turtle Model based off my design for Tidy For Turtles. I then

                                   printed this model using a MakerBot 3D printer. I printed a few different turtles and have altered my blender and stl files
                                    accordlingly by making minor adjustments to the turtle's legs so that it sits up on its own. The best of part of printing these turtles 
                                    is painting them (my favorite version is the one I turned into <a style="color:#0077B6" target="_blank" href="turtle.html">spider turtle</a>). 
                                    Besidees turtles I've made other 3D print models using blender such as a unicorn and a snowman.

                                    to promote healthy relationships among adolescents. The app features a quiz game that introduces 
                                    users to different relationship scenarios which they have to decide whether or not they're healthy. In addition 
                                    the app provides users with hotlines to recieve help as well website links for more infromation and support. All text and images were 
                                    provided by the District Attorney's office, and I built the app according to the features were requested. I programmed the

                                    CarbonCalc that I programmed with swift and swiftui. There are two sections to the app where users can either learn about 
                                    carbon footprints or calculate their own. In the learning section users can click through different screens to learn and then take a

                                   then tells the user whether or not they will have saved their desired amount. The user enters the amount of moeny they want to have 
                                   for a down payment, the interest rate, their starting amount, and the nubmer of years until they want to buy a house, and the app then calculates how much money they will have by the end of the chosen time period 
                                   so that it can tell the user whether or not they'll have enough money. The calculator is marketed towards future
                                   home owners looking to see if they have saved enough for their homes, but it will work to calculate the potential of any savings 
                                   goal involving simple intrest since it uses a standard formula.
