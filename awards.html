            My app CarbonCalc won the 2023 Congressional App Challenge. CarbonCalc is a carbon footprint calculator
             I developed inspired by an assignment in my environmental science class where I had to calculate my carbon footprint by hand. 
             Originally developed in JavaScript on Code.org, CarbonCalc is comprised of two features: a quiz game to teach users about carbon 
             emmissions and calculator where users can calucalte their personal emmisions in different activities. Since winning I have had the 
             oppurtunity to display my app at the US Capitol building at House of Code 2024. I have also recreated CarbonCalc in Swift and SwiftUI
              and am in the process of putting it on the app store.
